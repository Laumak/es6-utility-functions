# ES6 utility functions

This repo is a collection of random useful utility functions. You might as well be using Lodash (and probably should!), but I like tinkering with stuff like this! :)

## Running tests
- Install project dependencies
  - `yarn`
- Run the whole test suite
  - `yarn test`
- "Watch" tests
  - `yarn test:watch`
